<h2>Profile template</h2>

For all people that share their profile on this site, we'd like for them to have the following: 

<ul>
    <li>Picture of yourself (if you're comfortable adding one)</li>
    <li>Years of experience in technology</li>
    <li>Provide perspective on your background – what got you to here?</li>
    <li>What's your reason–impact, money, flexibility?</li>
    <li>What are some of your strategies for success–what do you use to succeed?</li>
    <li>What are some resources for people who want to learn from your experience–websites you use, communities you're a part of?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

* 1-2 paragraphs is great here. We're looking to concise, but we're open to longer stories if your experience warrants
one. Consider linking to bigger stories on Medium or Dev.to
* The personal narrative is more important than external links. Help people see themselves in your story.
