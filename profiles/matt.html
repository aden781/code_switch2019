15 years experience.

<p>I had a straight-forward entrance into IT through college. What happened after that was unexpected. I felt more comfortable <i>talking</i> about technology than being paid to build it, so I shifted, unintentionally, into a career in marketing. My job these days is to engage, inspire, and communicate about technology effectively. It's challenging, and it regularly requires that I understand my audiences (IT operators, developers) and my company (sales objectives, business model). I continue to stay in tech because it allows me to afford a great life for my family and gives me the flexibility I want in my life (remote work being a big part of that). I've worked at 10 person startups and 100,000 person enterprises, and I'm happy to talk to you about both.</p>

<p>When it comes to advice, the one must do is to find your community. Whether that is a best friend who is motivated to learn with you or an international group centered on a type of technology, find people to grow with and learn from regularly. It's an essential part of the work, and it makes it a whole lot more fun. Some of my favorites are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Open Source community through <a href="https://opensource.com">Opensource.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, or sub-communities like the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/">OSI subreddit</a></li> 
    <li>Python community through <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/python/">local meetups</a> and the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/membership/">Python Software Foundation</a></li>
    <li>DevOps community through <a href="https://devopsdays.org">DevOpsDays</a> and <a href="https://signup.hangops.com/">HangOps</a></li>
</ul>
