    <p>3 years experience in tech</p>

    <p>My career path in tech has been pretty non-linear. I worked with Geographic Information Systems as an undergrad,
        but fell into working in banking when I failed to obtain a funded graduate school opportunity. It turns out that
        spending every day making rich people richer was not a rewarding career path, so I went back to school to become
        a high school teacher. I worked in education as a classroom teacher and non-profit administrator for 12 years
        before deciding to make another career change. I am currently a graduate student and research assistant at the
        University of Minnesota, working in Spatial Data Science, with a focus on understanding the intersection of
        transit and equity.</p>

    <p>Strategies for success:</p>
    Be OK with being confused, you absolutely cannot understand everything the first time<br>
    Connect with people who are willing to help you<br>
    Change things and see what happens<br>
    RTFM<br>
