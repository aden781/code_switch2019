<h2>Guidelines</h2>

* 1-2 paragraphs is great here. We're looking to concise, but we're open to longer stories if your experience warrants
one. Consider linking to bigger stories on Medium or Dev.to
* The personal narrative is more important than external links. Help people see themselves in your story.
