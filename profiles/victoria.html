<h2>Victoria Adofoli</h2>
~1 year experience in technology.

<p>I am a motivated PM professional who enjoys using Agile methodology to promote success. Prior to this, I have 7 years of experience in public service and non-governmental work. My reasoning for entering into the tech space is to maximize my impact and inspire digital development on a global scale.</p>

<p>I am a newbie in the tech space so strategies that I am using include connecting with experienced IT project managers virtually, in person, social gatherings, and conferences. I schedule bi-weekly informational interviews with black women in the tech space. I host and participate in international dinners to connect with internationals that work in the tech space. Moreover, I love to learn so I use Lynda.com, YouTube to gain more knowledge of new project management software. I also use Skill Success and NBC News Shop to get affordable price for products were selected by StackCommerce.</p>
