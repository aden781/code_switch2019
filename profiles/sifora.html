<p>Professionally, I have been in tech for one year as a software engineer. However I have interned and worked part time in tech related fields since I was in high school.</p>

<p>I got interested in technology through sheer chance. My friend told me about an organization she was joining called BDPA. This was in 9th grade. BDPA specializes in teaching young students IT skills such as web development, and professional skills like writing a resume. It was through them I eventually got my first internship with Medtronic at the age of 16. I had such a great time during those years, and I learned so much! In a few more years, I decided I wanted to study Computer Science at the University Of Minnesota (came in to school wanting to be a medical student, left a computer nerd). After I graduated college I took a year off, then went to work as a Software Engineer! I went back to BDPA and continued as a volunteer, and eventually as the head instructor of the Twin Cities chapter.</p> 

<p>I love money, I love a work/life balance, I love coding. My job is an awesome mix of all that.</p>

<p>If you want to be successful, you can't be a passive observer of your future. Be active, do something in the field you are interested in, join organizations that line up with your goals. I taught HTML and CSS for a year, and employers it. You need more than HTML and CSS to effectively develop, but they liked that I was able to explain concepts in a clear and concise manner.</p>

<ol>
    <il>BDPA is an organization in multiple cities, if you want to volunteer, it looks great on a resume and you can really help your community.</il>
    <il>Use the internet. YouTube, Stackoverflow, Docs from different groups. The information is out there, you just need to find it.</il>
