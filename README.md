# code_switch2019

This project is a result of participating in [Code Switch MN](https://www.codeswitch.mn/) as part of [#DayOfCivicHacking](https://nationaltoday.com/national-civic-day-hacking/).

## Mission

Our objective is to design a place to learn about technology careers from people who are like you.

## About the mission

Our goal is to provide a resource of people who look and feel representative of the diverse set of circumstances that bring people into a career in technology-centric fields. That sense of finding someone who represents you–your culture, your background, your struggles–who has succeeded in a career you want to succeed in can be can make all the difference. It means more people like you seeing that you can succeed. We want everyone to have that feeling when they use this project.

Some supporting statistics: 

- Technology can catapult people to the middle class by paying [well above the average wage](https://www.business.org/business/startup/highest-tech-salaries) compared to other jobs in respective areas.
- Technology is an attractive career option for people with different backgrounds because its about continued learning as opposed to a specific background. 
- [Research](https://blog.salesflare.com/diversity-in-tech-industry) on diversity and inclusion in technology shows that representation is essential to long-term belonging.
- Representation is also a business imperative: A study [from McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) found that companies in the top quartile for gender or racial and ethnic diversity are “more likely to have financial returns above their national industry medians.”
- Our goal of connecting people through our work will help with the personal networks. In 2016, [LinkedIn estimated](https://news.linkedin.com/2017/6/eighty-percent-of-professionals-consider-networking-important-to-career-success) that 70% of people were hired at a company where they had a connection.

## Roadmap 

This is an MVP-style project to get the ball rolling. Our dream is to: 

- Connect to social media APIs (LinkedIn, Twitter) to allow for a quick template of people's stories to be automatically generated.
- Support a mentoring function where experts can be safely connected to mentees for a 15-minute informational discussion on career success.
